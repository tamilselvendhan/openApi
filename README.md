# openApi
Integrate OpenAPI with SpringBoot

**Descritption:**

Create Api's from OpenAPi configuration. So don't need to use number of annotaions in the controller class.

The code looks clean and understanble.

In future we can use the same config for backend api and front-end services in angular. 

So incase there is a change in the api then if change inthe yaml file and ran config it's enough. Changes will be reflected in both front-and and back-end


**How to run:**

1. As usual import project.
2. I assum you already setup Java and Maven home paths.
3. And run mvn clean command
4. Then mvn install
5. Finally ./mvnw spring-boot:run command to run the application in local
